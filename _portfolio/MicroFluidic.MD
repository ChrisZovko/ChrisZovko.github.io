## Introduction
  • Generally, describe μFluidic devices.
• What is pinch flow fractionation? How does it work?
• Provide at least one specific application that requires sorting of small particles. Include
at least one citation from primary literature. 

## Instructions
  • How to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device (Lab on a Chip paper). Include
the following steps but with additional detail:
o CAD model
o Print and cure mold
o Parylene device
o Cast PDMS
o Plasma bond glass slide

## Discussion 
  Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS? What are
hypothetical applications of your microfluidic mixer or sorter?
• Why is your geometry conducive to sorting? Discuss specific dimensions (pinch width,
outlet width, location of ports, etc.)
What steps or design features did you use to ensure that each outlet received the same
flow rate, preventing disruptions to the streamlines and maintaining proper separation?
• Based on the results of testing, could you implement any future changes to improve
sorting?
• Did you attempt the bonus opportunity? If so, describe your approach and success.
