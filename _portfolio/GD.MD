• Discussion (>750 words, no AI):
o Overview of the Part and Application
ChBE 4200
▪ Describe your final part and the real-world context it was designed for.
▪ What problem does it solve or what function does it improve?
▪ Why was this object or use case relevant or meaningful to you?
o Preserve and Obstacle Geometry
▪ What were the critical preserve regions in your model (e.g., mounting
points, tool interfaces, constrained paths)?
▪ How did you define obstacle geometry (i.e., space the part must avoid)?
o Load Case Application and Structural Constraints
▪ Explain the types of forces you applied in the generative design study and
why each was necessary.
▪ How did you determine the magnitude, direction, and location of each
load?
▪ Where did you apply structural constraints, and how did this affect the
results?
▪ How can you test your real-world prototype to further refine the loads?
o Critique of Generative Design
▪ In your experience, how useful is generative design for practical
engineering or prototyping?
▪ What limitations did you encounter?
▪ In what types of applications or industries would generative design be
most useful? Where might it fall short?
• Embedded Fusion 360 Model
• Table of the forces applied, including columns for
o Name of force
o Magnitude
o Location of where it was applied
o Short rational
• Multimedia:
o Real life image(s) of the model serving its desired purpose. Comparison to nongenerative design component if applicable.
o .GIF if there is motion in normal use
o Screenshot of the different iterations or solutions in the Fusion Generative
Design workspace.
